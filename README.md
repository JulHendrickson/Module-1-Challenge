# Coinbase Case Study - Module-1-Challenge

I selected Coinbase to research and write a Case Study about them for this Module 1 Challenge

## Some History of Coinbase

Coinbase is an American FinTech company and a cryptocurrency trading platform. Coinbase was founded in 2012 by Brian Armstrong and Fred Ehrsam. The idea for Coinbase came to Brian in 2011 when he began working weekends and nights to write code in Ruby and JavaScript to buy and store cryptocoins. Brian entered the Y Combinator startup accelerator in 2012 and received an investment of $150,000. He used this investment to fund Coinbase as a startup company. Later in May 2013, Coinbase received more investments worth $5 million led by Fred Wilson of Union Square Ventures. A second round of investments brought the company an additional $25 million. Olaf Carlson-Wee was the company's first employee and later became the cryptocurrency fund Polychain Capital CEO in 2013. 

By 2014, Coinbase had up to 1 million users and in 2015 Coinbase Global, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Delaware to hold Coinbase and its subsidiaries. Later that year in September 2015, Coinbase started offering services to Canada and Singapore. Coinbase was now going International! Coinbase was not the first cryptocurrency exchange to begin operating, but it was the first cryptocurrency exchange to become publicly traded when it debuted on NASDAQ in April 2021. By this time, Coinbase had already acquired 21 other companies to fuel its growth.

## What Coinbase Offers

As a FinTech company, Coinbase wants to build the cryptoeconomy. The idea is for anyone, anywhere to be able to send and receive cryptocurrency efficiently and transparently. Today, their platform allows you to buy and sell over 100 different cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin.

Coinbase's intended customers are any person or entity who wishes to buy, sell, hold or trade cryptocurrencies. It serves both individuals and businesses. With over 89 million users in over 100 countries, Coinbase is one of the most popular and trusted crypto asset exchange companies today. The company currently holds around $130 billion in assets and trades around $145 billion each quarter.

## Why Coinbase is so Popular

Although Coinbase is mostly recognized as a cryptocurrency exchange platform, it often acts as a decentralized financial system (DeFi) and a crypto app platform for developers. 

### Coinbase for Individuals
* Coinbase Platform - where cryptocurrencies are traded.
* Coinbase Wallet - where cryptocurrencies can be stored, received or sent to any other digital wallet.
* Coinbase Card - a debit card that works like a traditional bank debit card that can earn users crypto rewards.

### Coinbase for Businesses
* Coinbase Prime - for institutions investing at larger scales.
* Coinbase Commerce - for merchants to accept cryptocurrency payments fully decentralized.
* Coinbase Custody - for institutions to highly secure and store large amounts of cryptocurrencies.

### Coinbase for Developers
* Coinbase Cloud - a platform with blockchain infrastructure for building crypto projects.
* Rosetta - an open-source set of tools for blockchain integration.
* Coinbase Wallet SDK - allows developers to connect their dapps to Coinbase Wallet on both mobile web and desktop.

### Web 3.0
Web 3.0 is an evolving idea for a decentralized Internet based on public blockchain technology. It will empower users with total control over their digital content, data, and digital assets via blockchains. In an online world powered by blockchain tech, people will need digital wallets powered by the same blockchain tech to execute transactions a safe and secure way. That's where Coinbase Wallet comes in.

### Amazon Web Services

Back in 2014, Coinbase was looking for a better cloud technology provider. One that could not only handle the massive amounts of data moving daily, but could also give them total control over their environment instead of many different third-party hosting providers. They chose Amazon Web Services (AWS). With AWS's wide range of services covering their needs, Coinbase could focus on modernization and adding to their growing platform.

### Coinbase API for Integrations

Coinbase even offers an application programming interface (API) for developers to further functionalities of their apps by integrating cryptocurrencies. Coinbase Digital Currency API allows for: generating cryptocurrency wallets and addresses, Buying/selling and sending/receiving cryptocurrency, retrieving real-time and historical price information and of course receiving payments notifications.

## Major Crypto Trends
### Big Money Goes All In
One of the most significant trends in the crypto world happened in 2020 when major corporations and institutions allocated $15 billion to the crypto market. Before that, corporations and institutions always expressed uncertainty regarding cryptocurrencies and were reluctant to invest into this market. Warren Buffect has even called Bitcoin a "gambling token" in the past. He now has $1 billion invested in a crypto-friendly bank.

### NFT's
NFT stands for “Non-fungible Tokens.” NFTs have become tremendously popular in the cryptocurrency market. These are unique tokens that exist on a blockchain and are impossible to replicate. The NFTs can either represent physical items such as artwork or can represent digital items like domain names and video games. NFT's went mainstream in 2021, when sales from NFT's reached our $15 million.

### Other Players in Crypto Exchange

The global cryptocurrency market size was estimated at USD 4.67 billion in 2022. It's expected to reach USD 5.15 billion in 2023. So it makes sense that there are other big companies out there competing with the likes of Coinbase. Public, Kraken and Bisq are just three of many crypto exchanges that I've come across in my research.
* What are the other major companies in this domain?


## Closing Thoughts

Since its inception, Coinbase has educated people on cryptocurrencies and has given everyone access to cryptocurrencies.
It's one of the few exchanges that allows users to withdraw their crypto immediately. It has become one the most trusted due to its FDIC-secured accounts. It's also one of the safest as they won't hesitate to block suspicious accounts to ensure user safety.

## Core Metrics
In quarterly volume traded, Coinbase is second only to Binance who trades about $400 billion each quarter. When it comes to what cryptocurrencies to exchange and what fiat to support on their platform, Coinbase seems to focus on quality over quantity. so they don't have as many as some other crypto exchanges like KuCoin, which has over 800 coins and supports over 45 fiat currencies but only trades about $50 billion each quarter .
### Coinbase Quarterly Volume Traded (Q1 2023) - $145B 
### Coinbase Assets on Platform - $130B
### Coinbase Number of Coins - 243
### Coinbase Fiat Supported - USD, EUR, GBP

## Recommendations

I would recommend Coinbase  develop an augmented reality or virtual reality device that directly linked to their Coinbase wallets as a product offer to their account holders.
It would be an all in one VR with an integrated headset, microphone and two controllers to hold one in each hand. The headset would have fast switch display and allow six degrees of freedom. With bluetooth and Wi-Fi capabilities the VR connects directly to a Coinbase and you can begin buying and playing games or watching movies.
There are about 170 million VR users worldwide today and the number is expected to double soon. With VR on the way to becoming the new normal in entertainment and cryptocurrency doing the same in finance, Coinbase could distinguish itself greatly among almost 200 million potential more users.
