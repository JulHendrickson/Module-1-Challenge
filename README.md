# Coinbase Case Study - Module-1-Challenge

I selected Coinbase to research and write a Case Study about them for this Module 1 Challenge

## Some History of Coinbase

Coinbase is an American FinTech company and a cryptocurrency trading platform.
Coinbase was founded in 2012 by Brian Armstrong and Fred Ehrsam.
The idea for Coinbase came to Brian in 2011 when he began working weekends and nights to write code in Ruby and JavaScript to buy and store cryptocoins. 
Brian entered the Y Combinator startup accelerator in 2012 and received an investment of $150,000. He used this investment to fund Coinbase as a startup company. Later in May 2013, Coinbase received more investments worth $5 million led by Fred Wilson of Union Square Ventures. A second round of investments brought the company an additional $25 million.

## What Coinbase Offers

As a FinTech company, Coinbase wants to build the cryptoeconomy. The idea is for anyone, anywhere to be able to send and receive cryptocurrency efficiently and transparently.

Coinbase's intended customers are any person or entity who wishes to buy, sell, hold or trade cryptocurrencies. With over 89 million users in over 100 countries, Coinbase is one of the most popular and trusted crypto asset exchange companies today. The company currently holds around $130 billion in assets and trades around $145 billion each quarter.

# Why Coinbase is so Popular

Although Coinbase is most notable a cryptocurrency exchange platform, it also serves a decentralized financial system (DeFi) and a crypto app platform for developers. Individual services include a digital wallet to hold cryptocurrencies and a debit card program that earns users crpto rewards. Services for businesses include Coinbase Prime, a brokerage platform, and Coinbase Commerce, enabling businesses to accept cryptocurrency payments.

Coinbase was not the first cryptocurrency exchange to begin operating, but it was the first cryptocurrency exchange to become publicly traded when it debuted on NASDAQ in April 2021. By this time, Coinbase had already acquired 21 other companies to fuel its growth.


# Applications and Data
